# Federated Learning: Theory, Implementation, and Application

This repository accompanies a technical report exploring Federated Learning (FL) with a focus on the **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)** algorithm, alongside other algorithms such as **FedPer** and **SCAFFOLD**. We present both a from-scratch implementation and an application using the **Flower framework**, with comparisons against centralized training. The study includes experiments under IID and non-IID conditions on CIFAR-10 and methods for dealing with these scenarios.

Additionally, we explore privacy-preserving techniques and threat models in the federated setting. This includes implementations of **membership inference attacks**, **gradient leakage (DLG/iDLG)**, and defense mechanisms such as **differential privacy**.
