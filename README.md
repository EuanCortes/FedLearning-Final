# Federated Learning: Theory, Implementation, and Application

This repository accompanies a technical report exploring Federated Learning (FL) with a focus on the **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)** algorithm, alongside other algorithms such as **FedPer** and **SCAFFOLD**. We present both a from-scratch implementation and an application using the **Flower framework**, with comparisons against centralized training. The study includes experiments under IID and non-IID conditions on CIFAR-10 and methods for dealing with these scenarios.

Additionally, we explore privacy-preserving techniques and threat models in the federated setting. This includes implementations of **membership inference attacks**, **gradient leakage (DLG/iDLG)**, and defense mechanisms such as **differential privacy**.

## Virtual Environment

Create a new conda environment. Open the anaconda prompt and write the following command
```
conda create --name FLenv python=3.11.12 numpy scipy jupyter
```
Once it has finished installing the packages activate the environment with
```
conda activate FLenv
```
Next, go to the [pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), select the appropriate system specifications and select the pip package manager. Copy the given command and go back to the anaconda prompt and run the command. An example is given below:
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

```
Now we are ready to install the flower framework: we need the simulation package as well as the vision dataset:
```
pip install "flwr[simulation]" "flwr-datasets[vision]"
```
